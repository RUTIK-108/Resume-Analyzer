# 🚀 AI Resume Analyzer  
### Smart Resume–Job Description Matching System

An AI-inspired Resume Analyzer web application that evaluates resumes against job descriptions and highlights skill alignment to help candidates optimize their resumes for targeted roles.

- Improving resume targeting  
- Supporting smarter job applications
